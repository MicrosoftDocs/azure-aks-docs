# Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager

This page is an index of [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) built-in policy definitions for Azure Kubernetes Service which are included with those for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, see [Azure Policy built-in definitions](/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies).

The name of each built-in policy definition links to the policy definition in the Azure portal. Use the link in the **Version** column to view the source on the [Azure Policy GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).
