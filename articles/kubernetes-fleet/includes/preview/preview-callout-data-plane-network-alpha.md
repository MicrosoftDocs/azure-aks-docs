> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use.
>
> Our data plane networking previews are released via our `networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1` API. If you don't see preview objects, check that you're requesting the `networking.fleet.azure.com/v1alpha1` API when you interact with the Fleet Manager hub cluster.
