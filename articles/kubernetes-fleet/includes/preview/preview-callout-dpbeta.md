> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use.
>
> Our data plane previews are release via our v1beta1 API. If you don't see preview objects, check that you're requesting the v1beta1 API when you interact with the Fleet Manager hub cluster.
