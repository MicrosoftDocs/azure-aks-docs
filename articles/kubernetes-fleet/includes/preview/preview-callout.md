# Customer intent: "As a cloud architect, I want to explore the preview features of Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager, so that I can assess their capabilities for potential production use in my organization's Kubernetes deployments."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use.
