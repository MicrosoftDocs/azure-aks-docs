# Customize cluster-scoped resources in Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager with cluster resource overrides

This article provides an overview of how to use the `ClusterResourceOverride` API from the [Kubernetes Fleet open-source project](https://github.com/Azure/fleet/tree/main/docs) to customize cluster-scoped resources in Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Kubernetes Fleet).

You can modify or override specific attributes across cluster resources. With `ClusterResourceOverride`, you can define rules based on cluster labels and specify changes to be applied to various cluster-wide resources. These resources include namespaces, cluster roles, cluster role bindings, or custom resource definitions.

These modifications might include updates to permissions, configurations, or other parameters. Such updates help ensure consistent management and enforcement of configurations across your clusters managed through Kubernetes Fleet.

## API components

The `ClusterResourceOverride` API consists of the following components:

* `clusterResourceSelectors`: Specifies the set of cluster resources selected for overriding.
* `policy`: Specifies the set of rules to apply to the selected cluster resources.

### Cluster resource selectors

A `ClusterResourceOverride` object can include one or more cluster resource selectors to specify which resources to override. The `ClusterResourceSelector` object supports the following fields.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select a namespace in `ClusterResourceSelector`, the override will apply to all resources in the namespace.

* `group`: The API group of the resource.
* `version`: The API version of the resource.
* `kind`: The kind of the resource.
* `name`: The name of the resource.

To add a cluster resource selector to a `ClusterResourceOverride` object, use the `clusterResourceSelectors` field with the following YAML format:

```yaml
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
  name: example-cro
spec:
  clusterResourceSelectors:
    - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      version: v1
      name: secret-reader
```

This example selects a `ClusterRole` object named `secret-reader` from the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` API group for overriding:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

## Policy

A `Policy` object consists of a set of rules, `overrideRules`, that specify the changes to apply to the selected cluster resources. Each `overrideRules` object supports the following fields:

* `clusterSelector`: Specifies the set of clusters to which the override rule applies.
* `jsonPatchOverrides`: Specifies the changes to apply to the selected resources.

To add an override rule to a `ClusterResourceOverride` object, use the `policy` field with the following YAML format:

```yaml
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
  name: example-cro
spec:
  clusterResourceSelectors:
    - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      version: v1
      name: secret-reader
  policy:
    overrideRules:
      - clusterSelector:
          clusterSelectorTerms:
            - labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  env: prod
        jsonPatchOverrides:
          - op: remove
            path: /rules/0/verbs/2
```

This example removes the verb "list" in the `ClusterRole` object named `secret-reader` on clusters with the label `env: prod`.

### Cluster selector

You can use the `clusterSelector` field in the `overrideRules` object to specify the clusters to which the override rule applies. The `ClusterSelector` object supports the following field:

* `clusterSelectorTerms`: A list of terms that specify the criteria for selecting clusters. Each term includes a `labelSelector` field that defines a set of labels to match.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only `labelSelector` is supported in the `clusterSelectorTerms` field.

### JSON patch overrides

You can use `jsonPatchOverrides` in the `overrideRules` object to specify the changes to apply to the selected resources. The `JsonPatch` object supports the following fields:

* `op`: The operation to perform. Supported operations include:
  * `add`: Adds a new value to the specified path.
  * `remove`: Removes the value at the specified path.
  * `replace`: Replaces the value at the specified path.

* `path`: The path to the field to modify. Guidance on specifying paths includes:
  * Must start with a slash (`/`) character.
  * Can't be empty or contain an empty string.
  * Can't be a `TypeMeta` field (`/kind` or `/apiVersion`).
  * Can't be a `Metadata` field (`/metadata/name` or `/metadata/namespace`), except the fields `/metadata/labels` and `/metadata/annotations`.
  * Can't be any field in the status of the resource.

  Examples of valid paths include:  
  * `/metadata/labels/new-label`
  * `/metadata/annotations/new-annotation`
  * `/spec/template/spec/containers/0/resources/limits/cpu`
  * `/spec/template/spec/containers/0/resources/requests/memory`

* `value`: The value to add, remove, or replace. If `op` is `remove`, you can't specify `value`.

The `jsonPatchOverrides` fields apply a JSON patch on the selected resources by following [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902).

### Multiple override patches

You can add multiple `jsonPatchOverrides` fields to an `overrideRules` object to apply multiple changes to the selected cluster resources. Here's an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
  name: cro-1
spec:
  clusterResourceSelectors:
    - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      version: v1
      name: secret-reader
  policy:
    overrideRules:
      - clusterSelector:
          clusterSelectorTerms:
            - labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  env: prod
        jsonPatchOverrides:
          - op: remove
            path: /rules/0/verbs/2
          - op: remove
            path: /rules/0/verbs/1
```

This example removes the verbs "list" and "watch" in the `ClusterRole` object named `secret-reader` on clusters with the label `env: prod`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

## Apply the cluster resource placement

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Create a `ClusterResourcePlacement` resource to specify the placement rules for distributing the cluster resource overrides across the cluster infrastructure. The following code is an example. Be sure to select the appropriate resource.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1
    kind: ClusterResourcePlacement
    metadata:
      name: crp
    spec:
      resourceSelectors:
        - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          kind: ClusterRole
          version: v1
          name: secret-reader
      policy:
        placementType: PickAll
        affinity:
          clusterAffinity:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
              clusterSelectorTerms:
                - labelSelector:
                    matchLabels:
                      env: prod
    ```

    This example distributes resources across all clusters labeled with `env: prod`. As the changes are implemented, the corresponding `ClusterResourceOverride` configurations are applied to the designated clusters. The selection of a matching cluster role resource, `secret-reader`, triggers the application of the configurations to the clusters.

2. Apply the `ClusterResourcePlacement` resource by using the `kubectl apply` command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f cluster-resource-placement.yaml
    ```

3. Verify that the `ClusterResourceOverride` object was applied to the selected resources by checking the status of the `ClusterResourcePlacement` resource via the `kubectl describe` command:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe clusterresourceplacement crp
    ```

    Your output should resemble the following example:

    ```output
    Status:
      Conditions:
        ...
        Last Transition Time:   2024-04-27T04:18:00Z
        Message:                The selected resources are successfully overridden in the 10 clusters
        Observed Generation:    1
        Reason:                 OverriddenSucceeded
        Status:                 True
        Type:                   ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden
        ...
      Observed Resource Index:  0
      Placement Statuses:
        Applicable Cluster Resource Overrides:
          example-cro-0
        Cluster Name:  member-50
        Conditions:
          ...
          Message:               Successfully applied the override rules on the resources
          Observed Generation:   1
          Reason:                OverriddenSucceeded
          Status:                True
          Type:                  Overridden
         ...
    ```

    The `ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden` condition indicates whether the resource override was successfully applied to the selected resources in the clusters. Each cluster maintains its own `Applicable Cluster Resource Overrides` list. This list contains the snapshot of the cluster resource override, if relevant. Individual status messages for each cluster indicate whether the override rules were successfully applied.

### [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. On the Azure portal overview page for your Kubernetes Fleet resource, in the **Fleet Resources** section, select **Resource placements**.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Create a `ClusterResourcePlacement` resource to specify the placement rules for distributing the cluster resource overrides across the cluster infrastructure, as shown in the following example. Be sure to select the appropriate resource. Replace the default template with the YAML example, and then select **Add**.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1
    kind: ClusterResourcePlacement
    metadata:
      name: crp
    spec:
      resourceSelectors:
        - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          kind: ClusterRole
          version: v1
          name: secret-reader
      policy:
        placementType: PickAll
        affinity:
          clusterAffinity:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
              clusterSelectorTerms:
                - labelSelector:
                    matchLabels:
                      env: prod
    ```

    This example distributes resources across all clusters labeled with `env: prod`. As the changes are implemented, the corresponding `ClusterResourceOverride` configurations are applied to the designated clusters. The selection of a matching cluster role resource, `secret-reader`, triggers the application of the configurations to the clusters.

1. Verify that the cluster resource placement was created successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/cluster-resource-override/crp-success-inline.png" lightbox="./media/cluster-resource-override/crp-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal page for cluster resource placements, showing a successfully created placement.":::

1. Verify that the cluster resource placement was applied to the selected resources by selecting the resource from the list and checking the status.
