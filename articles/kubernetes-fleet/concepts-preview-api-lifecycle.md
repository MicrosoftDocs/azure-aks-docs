# Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager Preview API lifecycle

The Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager preview Azure Resource Manager (ARM) REST APIs (APIs that end in `-preview`) have a lifespan of approximately one year from their release date. This means that you can expect the 2024-05-02-preview API to be deprecated around May 3, 2025.
 
We love when people try our preview features and give us feedback, so we encourage you to use the preview APIs and the tools built on them.

After an API version is deprecated, it will no longer function. We recommend you routinely:

- Update your ARM/Bicep/Terraform templates using preview API versions to use the latest compatible version of the API.
- Update any preview SDKs or other tools built on the preview API to the latest version.

You should perform these updates at a minimum every 6-9 months. If you fail to do so, you'll be notified that you're using a soon-to-be deprecated API version as deprecation approaches.

This article covers Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager API deprecations. For Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) API deprecations, see [AKS preview API lifecycle](/azure/aks/concepts-preview-api-life-cycle).

## How to check API versions in use

If you're unsure what client or tool is using a specific API version, check the [activity logs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) using the following command. Update the `API_VERSION` with the version you want to check for.

```azurecli-interactive
API_VERSION="2024-05-02-preview"
az monitor activity-log list \
    --offset 30d \
    --max-events 10000 \
    --namespace microsoft.containerservice.fleets \
    --query "[?eventName.value == 'EndRequest' && contains(not_null(httpRequest.uri,''), '${API_VERSION}')]"
```

## How to check API versions used in templates

### [Bicep templates](#tab/bicep-templates)

In Bicep templates, look at the version of the resource which appears at the end of the resource type (`@2024-05-02-preview`). 

```bicep
resource symbolicname 'Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets@2024-05-02-preview' = {
    ...
}
```

### [ARM templates](#tab/arm-templates)

In ARM templates, check the `apiVersion` property.

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets",
  "apiVersion": "2024-05-02-preview",
  ...
}
```

### [Terraform templates](#tab/terraform-templates)

In Terraform, check the value of the `type` property which defines the resource type and API version (`@2024-05-02-preview`).

```json
resource "azapi_resource" "symbolicname" {
  type = "Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets@2024-05-02-preview"
  ...
}
```

## How to update tools and SDKs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure CLI and `fleet` extension **must** be updated to the latest version by using `az upgrade` and `az extension update --name fleet`.

- For Azure SDKs: Use a newer API version by updating to a [newer version of the SDK](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html?search=containerservicefleet).
- For Terraform: Update to the latest version of the AzureRM Terraform module. To find out what version of the API a particular Terraform release is using,
  check the [Terraform release notes](/azure/developer/terraform/provider-version-history-azurerm) or 
  git log [this file](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/internal/services/containers/client/client.go).
- For other tools: Update the tool to the latest version.
