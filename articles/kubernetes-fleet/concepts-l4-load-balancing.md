# Multi-cluster layer-4 load balancing (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview features note](./includes/preview/preview-callout.md)]

Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Fleet) can be used to set up layer 4 multi-cluster load balancing across workloads deployed across member clusters.

For multi-cluster load balancing, Fleet requires target clusters to be using [Azure CNI networking](/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni). Azure CNI networking enables pod IPs to be directly addressable on the Azure virtual network so that they can be routed to from the Azure Load Balancer.

The `ServiceExport` itself can be propagated from the fleet cluster to a member cluster using the Kubernetes resource propagation feature, or it can be created directly on the member cluster. Once this `ServiceExport` resource is created, it results in a `ServiceImport` being created on the fleet cluster, and all other member clusters to build the awareness of the service.

The user can then create a `MultiClusterService` custom resource to indicate that they want to set up Layer 4 multi-cluster load balancing. This `MultiClusterService` results in the member cluster mapped Azure Load Balancer being configured to load balance incoming traffic across endpoints of this service on multiple member clusters.
