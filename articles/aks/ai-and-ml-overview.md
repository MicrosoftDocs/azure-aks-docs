## AI/ML Workloads Overview 
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming the way we solve complex problems and deliver value to our customers. Generative AI has produced a paradigm shift that has transformed applications into data-driven, personalized experiences across a full range of applications involving text, code, images, videos, voice, music, and more. In doing so, we have also seen an increase in model size, operational complexity, and an increased need for security and cost-efficiency.  

To develop cutting-edge AI models, customers need to be able to allocate computing resources across diverse workloads. This includes not only model training but also serving, inference, and managing auxiliary tasks across infrastructure and workflow orchestration. 

## Challenges of AI / Workloads
To develop AI / ML applications effectively, it is essential to enable easy integration with open-source software, frameworks, and data platforms. Developing, refining, optimizing, deploying, and monitoring ML models can be challenging and complex. These inherent complexities require a platform, like AKS, that allows you to maximize the performance of core AI workloads while ultimately reducing inefficiencies and bottlenecks historically present when developing and deploying AI and ML workloads. 

## Developing and Deploying AI and ML applicaitons with AKS
Using AKS to host your AI and ML applications enables you to leverage high-performance infrastructure, cost-efficiencies, and robust security measures while maintaining the pace of innovation. Plus, AKS is an ideal platform for deploying and managing containerized applications that require high availability, scalability, and portability through the use of open-source tools and integration with existing DevOps processes. Azure Kubernetes Service reduces the operational burden of running ML workloads that are optimized for the computational and infrastructure load induced by developing and deploying AI applications. To support this, multiple best practice guides are available to help you deploy robust AI and ML solutions using AKS.
