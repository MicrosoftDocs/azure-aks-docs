# AKS regulated cluster for PCI DSS 4.0.1 - Continuous security monitoring

# Continuous Security and Monitoring for PCI DSS 4.0.1 in AKS


PCI DSS 4.0.1 emphasizes continuous security, monitoring, and threat detection. This document outlines best practices for implementing real-time compliance monitoring and automated alerting in AKS environments.

## AKS Feature Support

- **Azure Monitor**: Provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and log analytics for AKS clusters and workloads.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Delivers threat detection, vulnerability management, and compliance reporting for AKS.
- **Azure Policy**: Enables continuous compliance checks and enforcement of security standards.
- **Integration with SIEM/SOAR**: AKS logs and alerts can be integrated with SIEM/SOAR platforms for advanced threat detection and automated response.

## Your Responsibilities

- Integrate AKS with Azure Monitor and Microsoft Defender for Cloud for comprehensive monitoring and alerting.
- Automate compliance checks for PCI DSS controls using Azure Policy and custom scripts.
- Enable and review continuous vulnerability scanning for all container images and workloads.
- Document and regularly test incident response and escalation procedures for security events in AKS.
- Ensure monitoring covers ephemeral workloads, network activity, and privilege escalation attempts.

## Key Practices
- Integrate AKS with Azure Monitor, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and SIEM/SOAR solutions.
- Automate compliance checks and alerting for PCI DSS controls.
- Enable continuous vulnerability scanning and threat detection.
- Document incident response and escalation procedures.

## Example Integrations
- Azure Policy for continuous compliance
- Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for real-time alerting
- Defender for Cloud for threat detection


## Integrated AKS Security Context

This control should be implemented alongside:
- [pci-dss-network.md](network.md) for secure networking
- [pci-dss-identity.md](identity.md) for identity and access management
- [pci-dss-policy.md](policy.md) for policy and governance

For the latest AKS security features, see [Azure Kubernetes Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/).
