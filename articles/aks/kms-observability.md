# Observability for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption

This article shows you how to view observability metrics and improve observability for AKS clusters with KMS etcd encryption.

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster with KMS etcd encryption enabled. For more information, see [Add Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](./use-kms-etcd-encryption.md).
- You must enable [diagnostic settings for the key vault to check the encryption logs](/azure/key-vault/general/howto-logging).

## Check the KMS config

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

- Get the KMS config using the [`az aks show`][az-aks-show] command.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query "securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms"
   ```

    The output looks similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    ...
    "securityProfile": {
      "azureKeyVaultKms": {
        "enabled": true,
        "keyId": "https://<key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net/keys/<key-name>/<key-id>",
        "keyVaultNetworkAccess": "Public",
        "keyVaultResourceId": <key-vault-resource-id>
    ...
    ```

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
1. From the service menu, select **Diagnose and solve problems**.
1. In the search bar, search for **KMS** and select **Azure KeyVault KMS Integration Issues**.

    In the **Cluster is configured to use Azure KeyVault KMS Integration** section, you can see if KMS is enabled and the key ID, as shown in the following screenshot:

    For more information about your key vault, you can navigate to the key vault resource.

## Diagnose and solve problems

Because the KMS plugin is a sidecar of `kube-apiserver` pod, you can't access it directly. To improve the observability of KMS, you can check the KMS status using the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster.
1. From the service menu, select **Diagnose and solve problems**.
1. In the search bar, search for **KMS** and select **Azure KeyVault KMS Integration Issues**.

### Example problem

Let's say you see the following issue: `KeyExpired: Operation encrypt isn't allowed on an expired key`.

Because the AKS KMS plugin currently only allows bring your own (BYO) key vault and key, it's your responsibility to manage the key lifecycle. If the key is expired, the KMS plugin fails to decrypt the existing secrets. To resolve this issue, you need to _extend the key expiration date_ to make KMS work and _rotate the key version_.

## Next steps

For more information on using KMS with AKS, see the following articles:
