# Node images in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

This article describes the node images available for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.

## Node image releases

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) regularly provides new node images, so it's beneficial to upgrade your node images frequently to access the latest AKS features, component updates, and security fixes. You can find detailed summaries of each node image version in the [AKS VHD notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/tree/master/vhd-notes). 

Linux node images are released weekly, and Windows node images are released monthly. New node images are included in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

> **Best practice guidance**
>
> Configure [automatic node image upgrades](./auto-upgrade-node-os-image.md) and schedule them using [planned maintenance](./planned-maintenance.md). This will ensure that your node images are always up to date without requiring manual upgrades.

When new node images are released, it can take up to two weeks for the updates to be rolled out across all regions. The [AKS Release Tracker](./release-tracker.md) shows the current latest node image version, three previously available node image versions for each region, and the node image update order by region. Once the node image is available in your region, you can perform a [manual node image upgrade](./node-image-upgrade.md) or configure [automatic node image upgrades](./auto-upgrade-node-os-image.md) and schedule them using [planned maintenance](./planned-maintenance.md).

## Default node images

AKS sets a default operating system (OS) and node image during cluster and node pool creation. OS Type can be used to filter between Linux or Windows. 

| OS Type | Default OS | Default node image |
|--|--|--|
| Not Specified | Ubuntu Linux | Ubuntu with containerd and gen 2|
| Linux | Ubuntu Linux | Ubuntu with containerd and gen 2 |
| Windows | Windows Server | Windows Server Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) with containerd and gen 1 |

> [!NOTE]
> You can't specify the Windows OS Type during cluster creation since the system node pool in every cluster must be Linux.

### Supported OS versions

Each node image corresponds to an OS version which you can specify using OS SKU. You specify the following parameters when creating clusters and node pools:

* **--os-type**: OS type, including Linux or Windows.
* **--os-sku**: Used to specify OS version or OS variant.
* **--kubernetes-version**: Version of Kubernetes to use for creating the node pool or cluster.

> **Best practice guidance**
>
> The default OS version is the most recent validated version.
>
>   - For Ubuntu, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying `--os-type Linux` and `--os-sku Ubuntu`. This will automatically update you to the latest default Ubuntu version based on your Kubernetes version.
>   - For Azure Linux, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying `--os-type Linux` and `--os-sku AzureLinux`. This will automatically update you to the latest default Azure Linux version based on your Kubernetes version.
>   - For Windows, we recommend creating node pools while specifying `--os-type Windows` and `--os-sku Windows2022`. You will need to manually update node pools to the next OS version when it's released.

| OS Type | OS SKU | Supported Kubernetes versions | Default versioning |
|--|--|--|--|
| Linux | Ubuntu | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Kubernetes version 1.25 to 1.32. |
| Linux | Azure Linux | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Azure Linux 2.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.27 to 1.31. Azure Linux 3.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.32+. |
| Windows | Windows2019 | 1.14-1.32 | Default for Windows OS Type in Kubernetes version 1.14 to 1.24. |
| Windows | Windows2022 | 1.23 to 1.34 | Default for Windows OS Type in Kubernetes version 1.25 to 1.33. |

### Factors that might impact default node images

The following factors might impact the default image AKS chooses for your node pool:

- **OS SKU**: If `--os-sku` is specified, then your default OS changes. For example, if you specify Azure Linux as the OS SKU, then your node image is Azure Linux with containerd.
- **Virtual machine (VM) size**: 
    - [Confidential virtual machines (CVM)](./use-cvm.md)
    - [AMR64 virtual machines](./create-node-pools.md)
- **Hypervisor Generation**: Each VM size supports Generation 1, [Generation 2](./generation-2-vm.md), or both.
    - If a Generation 2 is supported, AKS defaults to using the Generation 2 node image.
    - If only Generation 1 is supported, AKS defaults to using the Generation 1 node image.
- **Feature enablement**: There are some features embedded into the node image. If you choose to use any of these features, your default node image changes.
    - [Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)](./enable-fips-nodes.md) changes the default node image for all Linux node pools.
    - [Pod Sandboxing](./use-pod-sandboxing.md) changes the default node image for Azure Linux node pools.
    - [Trusted Launch](./use-trusted-launch.md) changes the default node image for all Linux node pools.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain features can't be combined in a single node pool. Follow links to the feature documentation to review the limitations.

## Available Linux node images

### Ubuntu node images

The Ubuntu node images are fully validated by AKS and supported by Microsoft, Canonical, and the Ubuntu community. AKS won't retire an Ubuntu version before the end of Canonical's support lifecycle.
