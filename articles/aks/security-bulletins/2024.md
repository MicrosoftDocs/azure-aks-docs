# Security bulletins for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The AKS Security Bulletins page provides up-to-date information about security vulnerabilities affecting Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This includes details on:

- **Critical Security Advisories:** CVEs requiring immediate attention due to their severity, along with mitigation guidance.
- **Ongoing Security Investigations:** Security issues under review, including CVEs where a patch is not yet available or further assessment is needed.
- **False Positives & Non-Exploitable CVEs:** Cases where a reported CVE does not impact AKS due to specific configurations, mitigations, or lack of exploitability

## AKS-2024-001 net/netip Package Issues

**Published Date**: 03/31/2025

### Description

A security issue was discovered in net/netip package, where various Is methods (such as IsPrivate, IsLoopback, etc.) did not work as expected for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, returning false for addresses that would return true in their traditional IPv4 forms123. This flaw can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, allowing attackers to access all resources within the impacted kubernetes components.

## AKS-2024-002 runc CLI Security Issue

**Published Date**: 03/31/2025

### Description

A security issue was discovered in the runc version 1.1.11 and earlier for spawning and running containers on Linux. This vulnerability arises from an internal file descriptor leak, which can allow an attacker to cause a newly-spawned container process to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace. This can lead to a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem. 

### Affected Components

#### [**AKS Cluster**](#tab/aks-cluster)

**Affected Versions**

- AKS version 1.29.x and earlier


**Resolutions**

Upgrade AKS cluster version to 1.30 or later.

## AKS-2024-003 ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback Issue in golang/crypto

**Published Date**: 03/31/2025

### Description

A security issue was discovered in the ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback callback, which may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. This vulnerability arises when applications and libraries misuse the connection.serverAuthenticate method. Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. This can lead to incorrect authorization decisions based on keys that the attacker does not actually control

AKS is aware of the vulnerability. However, this CVE is not exploitable for kubernetes. The vulnerability only affects those who are using the PublicKeyCallback API. Since golang does not use this API in the Kubernetes setup, and the only use of the entire package is within a test suite golang.org/x/crypto is not vulnerable. The vulnerability will be patched in the upcoming Kubernetes release 1.33. 

### Affected Components

#### [**AKS Cluster**](#tab/aks-cluster)

**Affected Versions**

- AKS version 1.32 and earlier


**Resolutions**

Fix** will be available** in AKS cluster version 1.33

## AKS-2024-004 Nvidia Container Toolkit Issues

**Published Date**: 02/03/2025

### Description

NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.16.1 or earlier contains a Time-of-check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when used with default configuration where a specifically crafted container image may gain access to the host file system. This does not impact use cases where CDI is used. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.

### Affected Components

#### [**AKS Node Image**](#tab/aks-node-image)

**Affected Versions**

- Azure Linux 202409.30.0
- Ubuntu 202409.30.0

**Resolutions**

Upgrade AKS node image to 202410.09.0 or later.
