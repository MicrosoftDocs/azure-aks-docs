## AKS-2025-008 Nodes can bypass dynamic resource allocation authorization checks

**Published Date**: June 19, 2025

### Description

A security issue has been identified in Kubernetes related to the DynamicResourceAllocation feature. When enabled, this feature may allow users with pod creation privileges to escalate privileges or access unauthorized resources on the node.

This vulnerability only affects clusters where the DynamicResourceAllocation feature is explicitly enabled.

### References

- [CVE-2025-4563](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/132151)

### Affected Components

#### [**AKS Cluster**](#tab/aks-cluster)

**Affected Versions**

- None

**Resolutions**

- AKS does not support or enable the `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature in any supported version. AKS clusters are not vulnerable to this issue.
- Although AKS is not affected, the upstream fix will be included in the following AKS cluster versions:
  - AKS 1.32.6
  - AKS 1.33.2
- No customer action is required unless you are preparing for future use of this feature. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to the fixed versions once available.

## AKS-2025-007 Important Security Update for Kubernetes Nginx Ingress Controller

**Published Date**: March 24, 2025

### Description
Several security vulnerabilities affecting the Kubernetes nginx ingress controller were disclosed on March 24, 2025: CVE-2025-1098 (High), CVE-2025-1974 (Critical), CVE-2025-1097 (High), CVE-2025-24514 (High), and CVE-2025-24513 (Medium).
The CVEs impact ingress-nginx. (If you don't have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you aren't affected.)
You can check for ingress-nginx by running `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx` .

- [CVE-2025-1098](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131008)
- [CVE-2025-1974](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131009) 
- [CVE-2025-1097](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131007)
- [CVE-2025-24514](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131006)
- [CVE-2025-24513](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/131005)

### Affected Components

#### [**AKS Addons**](#tab/aks-addons)

**Affected Versions**

- < v1.11.0
- v1.11.0 - 1.11.4
- v1.12.0


**Resolutions**

- If you're using the [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](../app-routing.md) on AKS, the patches are getting rolled out to all regions with the AKS v2050316 release. **No action is required**. You can check the release status from [AKS release tracker][aks-release-tracker].

- If you're running your own Kubernetes NGINX Ingress Controller, review the CVEs and mitigate by updating to the latest patch versions (v1.11.5 and v1.12.1).

## AKS-2025-006 GitRepo Volume Inadvertent Local Repository Access
 
**Published Date**: March 13, 2025
 
### Description
A security vulnerability was discovered in Kubernetes that could allow a user with create pod permission to exploit gitRepo volumes to access local git repositories belonging to other pods on the same node. This CVE only affects Kubernetes clusters that utilize the in-tree gitRepo volume to clone git repositories from other pods within the same node. Since the in-tree gitRepo volume feature has been deprecated and will not receive security updates from Kubernetes upstream, any cluster still using this feature remains vulnerable.
 
### References
 
- [CVE-2025-1767](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/130786)
 
 
### Affected Components
 
#### [**AKS Cluster**](#tab/aks-cluster)
 
**Affected Versions**
 
- All AKS cluster versions
 
 
**Resolutions**
 
- Since the in-tree gitRepo volume feature has been deprecated, there is no fix available for the CVE.
 
- To ensure only allowed volume types are allowed, assign Azure built-in policy definition- [Kubernetes cluster pods should only use allowed volume types](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetail.ReactView/id/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F16697877-1118-4fb1-9b65-9898ec2509ec/version/5.2.0/scopes/%5B%22%22%5D) in enforce mode to your AKS clusters that blocks deployments with gitRepo volume usage. You may view the allowed volume types [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/8c4af2801d999ef960fe9a10a1f04375954c10a7/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Kubernetes/PSPRestrictedStandard.json#L191). For detailed steps on how to enable Azure Policy on your AKS cluster, please review [Secure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with Azure Policy](../use-azure-policy.md).

## AKS-2025-001 ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback Issue in golang/crypto

**Published Date**: December 11, 2024

### Description

A security issue was discovered in the ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback callback, which may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. This vulnerability arises when applications and libraries misuse the connection.serverAuthenticate method. Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. This issue can lead to incorrect authorization decisions based on keys that the attacker doesn't actually control

AKS is aware of the vulnerability. However, this CVE isn't exploitable for kubernetes. The vulnerability only affects those users who are using the PublicKeyCallback API. Since golang doesn't use this API in the Kubernetes setup, and the only use of the entire package is within a test suite golang.org/x/crypto isn't vulnerable. The vulnerability is patched in the upcoming Kubernetes release 1.33. 

### References
- [CVE-2024-45337](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45337)

### Affected Components

#### [**AKS Cluster**](#tab/aks-cluster)

**Affected Versions**

- AKS version 1.32 and earlier

**Resolutions**

Fix **will be available** in AKS cluster version 1.33
