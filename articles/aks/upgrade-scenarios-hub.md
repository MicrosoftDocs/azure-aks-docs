# AKS Upgrade Scenarios: Choose Your Path

Upgrading Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters safely requires the right strategy for your specific situation. Use this hub to quickly identify your scenario and get targeted guidance.

## 📖 What This Article Covers

This **decision hub** helps you choose the right AKS upgrade approach based on:
- **Quick scenario finder** with time constraints and priorities
- **Emergency upgrade paths** for critical security responses
- **Strategy matrix** comparing downtime tolerance and complexity
- **Role-based guidance** for SREs, DBAs, developers, and security teams
- **Decision trees** for complex multi-environment setups

**Best for:** First-time upgraders, teams evaluating options, complex environments requiring tailored approaches.

**Related guides:** [Production strategies](aks-production-upgrade-strategies.md) • [Stateful workloads](stateful-workload-upgrades.md) • [Basic upgrades](upgrade-aks-cluster.md)
