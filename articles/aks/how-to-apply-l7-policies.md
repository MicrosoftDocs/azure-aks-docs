# Set up Layer 7(L7) Polices with Advanced Container Networking Services (Public Preview)

This article shows you how to set up L7 policy with Advanced Container Networking Services in AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
[!INCLUDE [azure-CLI-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

 The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.56.0. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).


### Install the `aks-preview` Azure CLI extension

Install or update the Azure CLI preview extension using the [`az extension add`](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_add) or [`az extension update`](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_update) command.

```azurecli-interactive
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview
# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

### Register the `AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview` feature flag

Register the `AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview` feature flag using the [`az feature register`](/cli/azure/feature#az_feature_register) command.

```azurecli-interactive 
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview"
```
Verify successful registration using the [`az feature show`](/cli/azure/feature#az_feature_show) command. It takes a few minutes for the registration to complete.

```azurecli-interactive
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview"
```

Once the feature shows `Registered`, refresh the registration of the `Microsoft.ContainerService` resource provider using the [`az provider register`](/cli/azure/provider#az_provider_register) command.

### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services

To proceed, you must have an AKS cluster with [Advanced Container Networking Services](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md) enabled.

The `az aks create` command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:
* **Container Network Observability:**  Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more visit [Container Network Observability](./container-network-observability-concepts.md).

* **Container Network Security:** Offers security features like FQDN filtering. To learn more visit  [Container Network Security](./advanced-container-networking-services-overview.md#container-network-security).

#### [**Cilium**](#tab/cilium)

> [!NOTE]
> Clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Observability and Container Network security starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.

```azurecli-interactive
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value. For this demo you will need --acns-advanced-network policies to at least have L7 enabled.

export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"

# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --location eastus \
    --max-pods 250 \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --network-plugin-mode overlay \
    --network-dataplane cilium \
    --node-count 2 \
    --pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
    --kubernetes-version 1.29 \
    --enable-acns \
    --acns-advanced-networkpolicies <L7/FQDN/None>
```

#### [**Non-Cilium**](#tab/non-cilium)

> [!NOTE]
> [L7 Policy](./container-network-security-l7-policy-concepts.md) feature is not available for Non-cilium clusters

### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

The [`az aks update`](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_update) command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`, updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features which includes [Container Network Observability](./container-network-observability-concepts.md) and the [Container Network Security](./container-network-security-concepts.md) feature.


> [!NOTE]
> Only clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services. For this demo you will need --acns-advanced-network policies to at least have L7 enabled.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --enable-acns \
    --acns-advanced-networkpolicies <L7/FQDN/None>
```

## Get cluster credentials 

Get your cluster credentials using the [`az aks get-credentials`](/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_get_credentials) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

## Setup Test application on your AKS Cluster

Follow steps on [AKS tutorial](./tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-application.md) to run an application on your cluster.

## Test connectivity with a policy



### Verify policy



## Clean up resources

If you don't plan on using this application, delete the other resources you created in this article using the [`az group delete`](/cli/azure/#az_group_delete) command.

```azurecli-interactive
  az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

## Next steps

In this how-to article, you learned how to install and enable security features with Advanced Container Networking Services for your AKS cluster.
