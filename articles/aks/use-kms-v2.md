# Migrate to Key Management Service (KMS) v2 in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this article, you learn how to migrate to KMS v2 for clusters with versions older than 1.27. Beginning in AKS version 1.27, turning on the KMS feature configures KMS v2. With KMS v2, you aren't limited to the 2,000 secrets that earlier versions support. For more information, see [KMS v2 improvements](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/16/kms-v2-moves-to-beta/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your cluster version is older than 1.27 and you already turned on KMS, the upgrade to cluster version 1.27 or later is blocked.

## Turn off KMS

1. Disable KMS on an existing cluster using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command with the `--disable-azure-keyvault-kms` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --disable-azure-keyvault-kms
    ```

1. Update all secrets using the `kubectl get secrets` command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.

    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -
    ```

## Upgrade your AKS cluster and turn on KMS

1. Upgrade your AKS cluster to version 1.27 or later using the [`az aks upgrade`][az-aks-upgrade] command with the `--kubernetes-version` parameter set to your desired version. The following example upgrades to version `1.27.1`:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks upgrade --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --kubernetes-version 1.27.1
    ```

1. Once the upgrade completes, you can turn on KMS for a public or private key vault using one of the following resources:

    - [Enable a public key vault and KMS on an existing AKS cluster](./use-kms-etcd-encryption.md#enable-a-public-key-vault-and-kms-on-an-existing-aks-cluster)
    - [Update an existing AKS cluster to turn on KMS etcd encryption for a private key vault](./use-kms-etcd-encryption.md#update-an-existing-aks-cluster-to-turn-on-kms-etcd-encryption-for-a-private-key-vault)

1. Update all secrets using the `kubectl get secrets` command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.

    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -
    ```
