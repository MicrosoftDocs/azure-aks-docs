# Concepts - Machine learning operations (MLOps) for AI and machine learning workflows

In this article, you learn about machine learning operations (MLOps), including what types of practices and tools are involved, and how it can simplify and speed up your AI and machine learning workflows on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## What is MLOps?

Machine learning operations (MLOps) encompasses practices that facilitate collaboration between data scientists, IT operations, and business stakeholders, ensuring that machine learning models are developed, deployed, and maintained efficiently. MLOps applies DevOps principles to machine learning projects, aiming to automate and streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This lifecycle includes training, packaging, validating, deploying, monitoring, and retraining models.

MLOps requires multiple roles and tools to work together effectively. Data scientists focus on tasks related to training the model, which is referred to as the ***inner loop***. Machine learning engineers and IT operations teams handle the ***outer loop***, where they apply DevOps practices to package, validate, deploy, and monitor models. When the model needs fine-tuning or retraining, the process loops back to the inner loop.

### MLOps pipeline

Your MLOps pipeline may leverage various tools and microservices that are deployed sequentially or in parallel. Below are examples of key components in your pipeline that benefit from implementing the following best practices to reduce overhead and allow for faster iteration:

- Unstructured data store for new data flowing into your application
- Vector database to store and query structured, pre-processed data
- Data ingestion and indexing framework
- Vector ingestion and/or model retraining workflows
- Metrics collection and alerting tools (tracking model performance, volume of ingested data, etc.)
- Lifecycle management tools

## DevOps and MLOps

DevOps is a combination of tools and practices that enable you to create robust and reproducible applications. The goal of using DevOps is to quickly deliver value to your end users. Creating, deploying, and monitoring robust and reproducible models to deliver value to end users is the primary goal of MLOps.

There are *three* processes that are essential to MLOps:

* **Machine learning workloads** for which a data scientist is responsible, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training and tuning.
* **Software development practices** including planning, developing, testing, and packaging the model for deployment.
* **Operational aspects of deploying and maintaining the model in production**, including releasing, configuring resources, and monitoring the model.

### DevOps principles that apply to MLOps

MLOps leverages several principles from DevOps to enhance the machine learning lifecycle, such as *automation*, *continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)*, *source control*, *Agile planning*, and *infrastructure as code (IaC)*.

#### Automation

By automating tasks, you can reduce manual errors, increase efficiency, and ensure consistency across the ML lifecycle. Automation can be applied to various stages, including data collection, model training, deployment, and monitoring. Through automation, you can also apply proactive measures in the AI pipeline to ensure data compliance with your organization's policies.

For example, your pipeline can automate:

* Model tuning/retraining at regular time intervals or when a certain amount of new data is collected in your application.
* Detection of performance degradation to kickstart fine-tuning or retraining on a different subset of data.
* Common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) scanning on base container images pulled from external container registries to ensure safe security practices.

#### Continuous integration (CI)

Continuous integration covers the *creating* and *verifying* aspects of the model development process. The goal of CI is to create the code and to verify the quality of the code and the model before deployment. This includes testing on a range of sample data sets to ensure that the model performs as expected and meets quality standards.

In MLOps, CI might involve:

* Refactoring exploratory code in Jupyter notebooks into Python or R scripts.
* Validating new input data for missing or error values.
* Unit testing and integration testing in the end-to-end pipeline.

To perform linting and unit testing, you can use automation tools like Azure Pipelines in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

#### Continuous delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery involves the steps needed to safely deploy a model in production. The first step is to package and deploy the model in *pre-production environments*, such as dev and test environments. Portability of the parameters, hyperparameters, and other model artifacts is an important aspect to maintain as you promote the code through these environments. This portability is especially important when it comes to large language models (LLMs) and stable diffusion models. Once the model passes the unit tests and quality assurance (QA) tests, you can approve it for deployment in the *production environment*.

#### Source control

Source control, or *version control*, is essential for managing changes to code and models. In an ML system, this refers to data versioning, code versioning, and model versioning, which allow cross-functional teams to collaborate effectively and track changes over time. Using a Git-based source control system, like [**Azure Repos**](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/repos/#:~:text=Overview.%20Free%20private%20Git%20repositories,%20pull%20requests,%20and?msockid=182ea2d5e1ff6eb61ccbb1b8e5ff608a) in Azure DevOps or a **GitHub repository**, enables you to programmatically maintain a history of changes, revert to previous versions, and manage branches for different experiments.

#### Agile planning

Agile planning involves isolating work into *sprints*, which are short time frames for completing specific tasks. This approach allows teams to adapt to changes quickly and deliver incremental improvements to the model. Model training can be an ongoing process, and Agile planning can help scope the project and enable better team alignment.

You can use tools like [**Azure Boards**](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards) in Azure DevOps or **GitHub issues** to manage your Agile planning.

#### Infrastructure as code (IaC)

You use infrastructure as code to repeat and automate the infrastructure needed to train, deploy, and serve your models. In an ML system, IaC helps simplify and define the appropriate Azure resources needed for the specific job type in code, and the code is maintained in a repository. This allows you to version control your infrastructure and make changes for resource optimization, cost-effectiveness, etc. as needed.
