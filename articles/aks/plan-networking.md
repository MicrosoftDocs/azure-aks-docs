# Plan networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads

This article provides an overview of the networking components you need to consider when planning your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads.

## Networking components

When planning your AKS networking, you need to consider four main components: the **control plane**, **nodes**, **pods**, and **applications**.

Each component has its own networking requirements, considerations, and options. You can use the following articles to learn more about and plan for each component:

- [Plan control plane networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./plan-control-plane-networking.md)
- [Plan node networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./plan-node-networking.md)
- [Plan pod networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./plan-pod-networking.md)
- [Plan application networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./plan-application-networking.md)

Each article poses a question to help guide your planning, and then provides options, recommendations, and best practices.
