# Replicate an Amazon Web Services (AWS) web application with AWS WAF in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this article, you learn how to replicate an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) web application with AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) using [Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)][azure-waf] and [Azure Application Gateway][azure-ag] in [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][aks]. 

This workload implements a WAF to protect a [Yelb][yelb] web-based application running in a Kubernetes cluster. Applications rely on WAFs to block unwanted traffic and protect apps from common vulnerabilities. A centralized web application firewall helps simplify security management and helps ensure better protection against threats or intrusions.

For a more detailed understanding of the AWS workload, see [Protecting your Amazon EKS web apps with AWS WAF][eks-aws-waf].

## Deployment process

1. [**Understand the conceptual differences**](eks-web-understand.md): Start by reviewing the differences between EKS and AKS in terms of services, architecture, and deployment.
1. [**Rearchitect the workload**](eks-web-rearchitect.md): Analyze the existing AWS workload architecture and identify the components or services, like the workload infrastructure, application architecture, and deployment process, that you need to redesign to fit AKS.
1. [**Update the application code**](eks-web-refactor.md): Ensure your code is compatible with Azure APIs, services, and authentication models.
1. [**Prepare for deployment**](eks-web-prepare.md): Modify the AWS deployment process to use the Azure CLI.
1. [**Deploy the workload**](eks-web-deploy.md): Deploy the replicated workload in AKS and test the workload to ensure that it functions as expected.

## Prerequisites

- An active [Azure subscription](/azure/guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing). If you don't have one, create a [free Azure account][azure-free] before you begin.
- The **Owner** [Azure built-in role][azure-built-in-roles], or the **User Access Administrator** and **Contributor** built-in roles, on a subscription in your Azure account.
- [Azure CLI][azure-cli] version 2.61.0 or later. For more information, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].
- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) preview extension][aks-preview].
- [jq][install-jq] version 1.5 or later.
- [Python 3][install-python] or later.
- [kubectl][install-kubectl] version 1.21.0 or later
- [Helm][install-helm] version 3.0.0 or later
- [Visual Studio Code][download-vscode] installed on one of the [supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms) along with the [Bicep extension][bicep-extension].
- An existing [Azure Key Vault][azure-kv] resource with a valid TLS certificate for the Yelb web application.
- An existing [Azure DNS Zone][azure-dns] or equivalent DNS server for the name resolution of the [Yelb][yelb] application.

### Download the Azure application code

The **completed** application code for this workflow is available in our [GitHub repository][github-repo].

1. Clone the repository to a directory called `aws-to-azure-web-app-workshop` on your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/azure-samples/aks-web-application-replicate-from-aws ./aws-to-azure-web-app-workshop
    ```

2. After you clone the repository, navigate to the `aws-to-azure-web-app-workshop` directory and start Visual Studio Code using the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd aws-to-azure-web-app-workshop
    code .
    ```
