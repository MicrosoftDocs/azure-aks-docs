# Customer intent: As a cloud architect, I want to deploy a Valkey cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service, so that I can ensure high availability and scalability similar to the Azure Cache for Redis Premium tier while effectively utilizing availability zones.

# Deploy a Valkey cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

This article summarizes the steps to deploy Valkey, an open source (BSD) high-performance key/value datastore, on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The Valkey deployment focuses on leveraging replicas and availability zones for high availability and resilience. The goal of this solution is to deploy Valkey on AKS with a comparable level of service to the Azure Cache for Redis Premium tier. We also provide guidance to test the resilience of your Valkey deployment using the [Locust load testing framework](https://github.com/locustio/locust).

## What is Valkey?

[Valkey][valkey] is a fork of the [Redis project][redis] that preserves its original open-source license. Valkey is a high performance database that supports a key-value datastore, and you can use it for caching, session storage, message queues, and more. A _Valkey cluster_ has multiple nodes that are responsible for hosting your Valkey data stores. Valkey shards data into smaller portions and disperses it among the nodes. In a simplified Valkey cluster consisting of _three_ primary nodes, a single replica node supports each node to enable basic failover capabilities. The data is distributed across the nodes, enabling the cluster to continue functioning even if one of the nodes fails.

## Valkey solution overview

The goal of this solution is to deploy Valkey on AKS with the same level of service as the [Azure Cache for Redis][azure-cache-for-redis] Premium tier.

The following table lists key features of the Azure Cache for Redis Premium tier and the proposed Valkey solution:

| Azure Cache for Redis Premium tier | Valkey solution |
| --- | --- |
| **Memory up to 1.2 TB** | Using _three_ Valkey primaries running on the `Standard_E64_v5` SKU. |
| **Replication** | Adding at least _one_ replica pod per primary pod. |
| **Zone redundancy** | Placing primary and replica pods in different availability zones. |

We create two distinct [`StatefulSet`][kubernetes-stateful-sets] resources: one for the Valkey primaries and one for the replicas. The `spec.affinity` of the `StatefulSet` API places the primary pods in two different availability zones and the replica pods in another third availability zone. This approach ensures that a single zone failure doesn't impact the availability for any Valkey shard.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the solution suggested in this article differs from the Valkey documentation, where cluster Pods belong to a single `StatefulSet`, and the `spec.affinity` only ensures that the Pods are placed on different nodes. The automatic Valkey cluster initialization presented in the Valkey documentation doesn't ensure that the primary and replica Pods for the same shard are placed in different availability zones.
