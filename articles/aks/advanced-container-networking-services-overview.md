# What is Advanced Container Networking Services?

Advanced Container Networking Services is a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. The suite addresses challenges in modern containerized applications, such as observability, security, and compliance.

Advanced Container Networking Services focuses on delivering a seamless and integrated experience that helps you maintain robust security postures and gain deep insights into your network traffic and application performance. It helps ensure that your containerized applications aren't only secure, but also that they meet or exceed your performance and reliability goals. Advanced Container Networking Services helps you confidently manage and scale your infrastructure.

## What is included in Advanced Container Networking Services?

Advanced Container Networking Services offers two key features:

- **Container Network Observability:** The inaugural feature of the Advanced Container Networking Services suite, bringing the power of Hubbleâ€™s control plane to both Cilium and non-Cilium Linux data planes. These features aim to provide visibility into networking and performance.

- **Container Network Security:** For clusters that use Azure CNI Powered by Cilium, network policies include Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering for tackling the complexities of maintaining configuration.

## Container Network Observability

Container Network Observability in AKS is a comprehensive feature set within Advanced Container Networking Services, designed to provide deep insights into network traffic and performance across containerized environments. It works seamlessly across both Cilium and non-Cilium data planes, offering flexibility for diverse networking needs. The feature uses eBPF to enhance scalability and performance by identifying potential bottlenecks and network congestion before applications are affected.

Key benefits include compatibility with all Container Networking Interface (CNI) variants in Azure, detailed visibility into node-level metrics, and Hubble metrics for Domain Name System (DNS) resolution, pod-to-pod communication, and service interactions. Container network logs capture essential metadata such as IPs, ports, and traffic flow for troubleshooting, monitoring, and security enforcement.

It also integrates with the managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor and Azure Managed Grafana for simplified metrics storage and visualization. Whether you use managed services or your own infrastructure, this observability solution helps ensure a highly performant, secure, and compliant network environment for AKS workloads.

### Container network metrics

This feature collects node-level metrics, including CPU, memory, and network performance, to monitor the health of cluster nodes. For deeper insights, Hubble metrics provide data on DNS resolution times, service-to-service communication, and pod-level network behavior. These metrics help you analyze application performance, detect anomalies, and optimize workloads.

For more information, see the [metrics overview](container-network-observability-metrics.md).

### Container network logs

Container network logs give you detailed insight into traffic within and across clusters by capturing metadata like source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and flow direction. These logs enable monitoring network behavior, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and enforcing security policies. Persistent and real-time logging options ensure comprehensive, actionable network observability.

To learn more, see the [container network logs overview](container-network-observability-logs.md).

## Container Network Security

Securing your containerized applications is essential in today's dynamic cloud environments. Advanced Container Networking Services provides features to strengthen your cluster's network security.

### FQDN-based filtering

Enhance egress control with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium DNS-based policies. Simplify configuration by using FQDNs instead of by managing dynamic IP addresses.

To learn more, see the [FQDN-based filtering overview](./container-network-security-fqdn-filtering-concepts.md).

### Layer 7 policy (preview)

Gain granular control over application-level traffic. Implement policies based on protocols like HTTP, gRPC and kafka, securing your applications with deep visibility and fine-grained access control. To learn more, see the [Layer 7 policy overview](./container-network-security-l7-policy-concepts.md) documentation.
