# What is Advanced Container Networking Services?

Advanced Container Networking Services is a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. The suite addresses challenges in modern containerized applications, such as observability, security, and compliance.

With Advanced Container Networking Services, the focus is on delivering a seamless and integrated experience that enables you to maintain robust security postures and gain deep insights into your network traffic and application performance. This ensures that your containerized applications are not only secure but also meet or exceed your performance and reliability goals, allowing you to confidently manage and scale your infrastructure.

## What is included in Advanced Container Networking Services?

Advanced Container Networking Services contains features split into two pillars:

 - **Observability**: The inaugural feature of the Advanced Container Networking Services suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and non-Cilium Linux data planes. These features aim to provide visibility into networking and performance.

 - **Security**: For clusters using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium, network policies include fully qualified domain name (FQDN) filtering for tackling the complexities of maintaining configuration.

## Container Network Observability
 
Container Network Observability equips you with network related monitoring and diagnostics tools, providing  visibility into your containerized workloads. It unlocks Hubble metrics, Hubble’s command line interface (CLI) and the Hubble user interface (UI) on your AKS clusters providing deep, actionable insights into your containerized workloads allowing you to detect and determine the root causes of network-related issues in AKS. These features ensure that your containerized applications are secure and compliant in order to enable you to confidently manage your infrastructure.

For more information about Container Network Observability, see [What is Container Network Observability?](container-network-observability-concepts.md).

## Container Network Security

Container Network Security features within Advanced Container Networking Services enable greater control over network security policies for ease of use when implementing across clusters. Clusters using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium have access to DNS-based policies. The ease of use compared to IP-based policies allows restricting egress access to external services using domain names. Configuration management becomes simplified by using FQDN rather than dynamically changing IPs.


## Pricing
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Advanced Container Networking Services is a paid offering. For more information about pricing, see [Advanced Container Networking Services - Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-container-networking-services/)


## Set up Advanced Container Networking Services on your cluster

### Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
[!INCLUDE [azure-CLI-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

* The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.61.0. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension
Install or update the Azure CLI preview extension using the [`az extension add`](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_add) or [`az extension update`](/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_update) command.

```azurecli-interactive
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview

# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

### Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Create a resource group using the [`az group create`](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) command.

```azurecli-interactive
# Set environment variables for the resource group name and location. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>"
export LOCATION="<azure-region>"
# Create a resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```

### Enable and Disable Advanced Container Networking Services in AKS cluster

#### Create an AKS cluster with Advanced Container Networking Services

The `az aks create` command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:

```azurecli-interactive
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"

# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --location eastus \
    --max-pods 250 \
    --network-plugin azure \
    --network-plugin-mode overlay \
    --network-dataplane cilium \
    --node-count 2 \
    --pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
    --kubernetes-version 1.29 \
    --enable-acns
```
