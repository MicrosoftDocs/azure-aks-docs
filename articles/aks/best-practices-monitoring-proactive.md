# Proactive monitoring best practices for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

This article covers the best practices for proactive monitoring on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and provides a comprehensive list of the key signals AKS recommends for you to monitor.

Proactively monitoring your AKS clusters is crucial for reducing downtime and saving business interruptions for your applications. This process involves identifying and monitoring key indicators of abnormal behavior in your cluster that might lead to major issues or downtime. 

## Monitoring and alerting overview

Monitoring on AKS involves using metrics, logs, and events to ensure the health and performance of your cluster. Common scenarios to monitor include node performance, pod status, and overall resource utilization in your cluster. Logs provide insights into system events and cluster operations and activity. For more information about the methods and signals AKS provides for monitoring, see [Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](./monitor-aks.md).

The best way to proactively monitor your cluster is to configure [Azure Monitor alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview). Alerts act as proactive measures to notify you of potential issues or anomalies before they escalate into critical problems. By defining thresholds for key metrics and logs, you receive immediate alerts when these signals exceed predefined limits, indicating potential issues like resource exhaustion or application failures. We highly recommend defining [service-level objectives (SLOs)](/azure/well-architected/reliability/metrics) for your application to measure the performance and reliability of your service. Configuring alerts on the key signals for your SLOs allows you to quickly detect any degradation of your application's quality of service that your customers receive. Overall, setting timely alerts enables you to quickly investigate and remediate problems, minimizing downtime and ensuring high availability of applications running on your AKS cluster.

## How to configure alerts on specific metric types

| Metric type | Where to find these metrics | How to configure alerts |
|---|---|---|
| AKS Platform Metric | View [platform metrics](./monitor-aks.md#azure-monitor-platform-metrics) through the Metrics blade in the Azure portal. | You can create, update, and delete metric alerts through the Azure portal. For more information, see [Create a metric alert for an Azure resource](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/tutorial-metric-alert). |
| Azure Managed Prometheus Metric | To access Prometheus metrics, you need to enable Managed Prometheus. For details on how to enable and view Prometheus metrics, see [Azure Monitor and Prometheus](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview). | For guidance on configuring Prometheus alerts, see [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus rule groups](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-rule-groups). |
| Azure Activity Logs | View activity logs through the Azure portal. For more information, see [Azure activity logs for AKS](./monitor-aks.md#azure-activity-log). | Configure alerts on activity logs through the Azure portal. For more information, see [Activity log alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#activity-log-alerts). |
| Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set Metric | View the Virtual Machine Scale Set metrics through the Azure portal. | 1. To find the Virtual Machine Scale Set instance associated with your node pool, navigate to the **Settings > Properties** blade for your AKS cluster in the Azure portal. <br> 2. Select your **infrastructure resource group** to view the infrastructure resources associated with your cluster. <br> 3. Select the **Virtual Machine Scale Set instance** that matches the name of your node pool you're creating alerts for. <br> 4. Navigate to the **Alerts** blade to create your metric alert. |
| Load Balancer Metric | View load balancer metrics through the Load Balancer page in Azure portal. | 1. To find the load balancer instance associated with your node pool, navigate to the **Settings > Properties** blade for your AKS cluster in the Azure portal. <br> 2. Select your **infrastructure resource group** to view the infrastructure resources associated with your cluster. <br> 3.  Select the **load balancer instance** to bring up the Azure portal page for load balancer. <br> 4. Navigate to the **Alerts** page to create your load balancer metric alert. |
| Logs and Events | To alert on logs and events, you need to enable Container Insights. For more information, see [Azure Monitor resource logs](./monitor-aks.md#azure-monitor-resource-logs). | For guidance on creating alerts on logs and events, see [Create log search alerts from Container insights](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts). |

## Critical signals for configuring alerts

To get holistic coverage of your AKS environment, you need to configure alerts on the three main components of your cluster:

- **Cluster infrastructure**: Alerts targeting the underlying infrastructure of your cluster such as nodes, disks, and networking.
- **Application health**: Alerts for monitoring the health of your pods and applications. Some common indicators of unhealthy applications include out-of-memory kills (OOMKills) of your pods, pods in not ready state, etc.
- **Kubernetes control plane**: Alerts on AKS control plane to monitor the health and performance of the API server, etcd, and other components.

The following sections contain the key signals which we recommend all AKS customers monitor closely. The AKS team is working to add all critical signals to the existing [Recommended Alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-metric-alerts) feature, which allows you to easily enable alerts for all signals with a one-click experience. The Prometheus metrics alerts are available in Public Preview today, and the remaining alerts are estimated to be available in early 2025. For now, you can manually configure alerts on the critical signals.

### Cluster infrastructure alerts

| Alert scenario | Source | Signal | Recommended threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cluster is in a failed state | Azure Activity Logs | Create or update managed cluster | Status of the log is Failed, indicating that the cluster upgrade or creation action failed. |
| Node pool is in a failed state | Azure Activity Logs | Create or update agent pool | Status of the log is Failed, indicating that the node pool is in a Failed state due to a failed Create, Read, Upgrade, or Delete (CRUD) operation. |
| High Node OS Disk Bandwidth Usage | Virtual Machine Scale Set Metric | OS Disk Bandwidth Consumed Percentage | Node OS disk bandwidth utilization is above 95%. |
| High Node OS Disk IOPS Usage | Virtual Machine Scale Set Metric | OS Disk IOPS Consumed Percentage | Node OS disk IOPS utilization is above 95%. |
| High Node OS Disk Space Usage | AKS Platform Metric | Disk Used Percentage | Node OS disk space percentage utilization is above 90%. |
| High Node CPU Usage | AKS Platform Metric | CPU Usage Percentage | Node CPU Usage is greater than 90%. |
| High Node Memory Usage | AKS Platform Metric | Memory Working Set Percentage | Node Memory Usage is greater than 90%. |
| Node is in NotReady state | AKS Platform Metric | Status for various node conditions | Node is in NotReady state for >20 minutes. |
| SNAT port exhaustion | Load Balancer (LB) Metric | SNAT Connection Count | Filter for Connection State = "Failed" |

### Application health alerts
