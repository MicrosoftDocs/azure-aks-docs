# Azure Policy Regulatory Compliance controls for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

[Regulatory Compliance in Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/regulatory-compliance)
provides initiative definitions (*built-ins*) created and managed by Microsoft, for the compliance domains and security controls related to different compliance standards. This page lists the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) compliance domains and security controls.

You can assign the built-ins for a **security control** individually to help make your Azure resources compliant with the specific standard.
