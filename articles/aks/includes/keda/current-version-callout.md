# Customer intent: "As an AKS user, I want to understand the KEDA version compatibility with my Kubernetes version, so that I can ensure my applications are running on a supported configuration."
---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your cluster Kubernetes version determines what KEDA version will be installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version). 
>
> For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:
