# Customer intent: "As a Kubernetes administrator, I want to restart the KEDA operator pods after enabling Workload Identity, so that I can ensure the environment variables are correctly injected for proper functionality."
---

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:
>
> 1. Restart the pods by running `kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`.
>
> 1. Obtain KEDA operator pods using `kubectl get pod -n kube-system` and finding pods that begin with `keda-operator`.
>
> 1. Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running `kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`.
> Under `Environment`, you should see values for `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`, and `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`.
