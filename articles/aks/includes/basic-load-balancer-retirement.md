> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **September 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Basic Load Balancer. To avoid any potential service disruptions, we recommend using Standard Load Balancer for new deployments and [upgrading any existing deployments to the Standard Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-basic-upgrade-guidance). For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/5020) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer/). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
