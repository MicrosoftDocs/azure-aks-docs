> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **September 30, 2026**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) on **Windows** nodes. This change applies only to customers already onboarded to NPM. **Subscriptions that aren't registered with this feature will no longer be able to onboard**. Existing onboarded customers can continue using NPM until the end-of-support date. To ensure your setup continues to receive support, security updates, and deployment compatibility, explore alternative options like [Network Security Groups (NSGs)](./concepts-network.md) on the node level or open-source tools like [Project Calico](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/calico/). For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](MISSING_LINK) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500273). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
