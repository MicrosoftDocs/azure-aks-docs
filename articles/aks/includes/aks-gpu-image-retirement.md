> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **January 10, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports AKS GPU image (preview). The custom header is no longer available, meaning that you can't create new GPU-enabled node pools using the AKS GPU image. Migrate to or use the default GPU configuration. For more information on this retirement, see [Retirement: AKS GPU image (preview)](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4472).
