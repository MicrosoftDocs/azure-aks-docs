> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **September 30, 2028**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) on **Linux** nodes. To avoid service disruptions, you need to [migrate AKS clusters running Linux nodes from NPM to Cilium Network Policy](./migrate-from-npm-to-cilium-network-policy.md) by the end-of-support date. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](MISSING_LINK) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500268). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
