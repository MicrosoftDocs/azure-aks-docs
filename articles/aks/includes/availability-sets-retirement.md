> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **September 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Availability Sets. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Clusters with Availability Sets after this date are considered out of support. Migrate all workloads to [Virtual Machines node pools](/azure/aks/virtual-machines-node-pools) before this date to ensure ongoing support and take advantage of enhanced management features.
