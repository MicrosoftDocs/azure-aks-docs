> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **September 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Availability Sets. Clusters with Availability Sets after this date are considered out of support. Migrate all workloads to [Virtual Machines node pools](/azure/aks/virtual-machines-node-pools) before this date to ensure ongoing support and take advantage of enhanced management features. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/5021) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](MISSING_LINK). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
