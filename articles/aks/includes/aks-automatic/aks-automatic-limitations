## Limitations

- AKS Automatic clusters' system nodepool require deployment in Azure regions that support at least three [availability zones](/azure/reliability/regions-list), ephemeral OS disk, and Azure Linux OS.
- You can only create AKS Automatic clusters in regions where [API Server VNet Integration](../api-server-vnet-integration.md#limited-availability) is generally available (GA).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AKS Automatic tries to dynamically select a virtual machine size for the `system` node pool based on the capacity available in the subscription. Make sure your subscription has quota for 16 vCPUs of any of the following sizes in the region you're deploying the cluster to: [Standard_D4lds_v5](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dldsv5-series), [Standard_D4ads_v5](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dadsv5-series), [Standard_D4ds_v5](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/ddv5-series), [Standard_D4d_v5](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/ddv5-series), [Standard_D4d_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dv4-series), [Standard_DS3_v2](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dsv3-series), [Standard_DS12_v2](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/memory-optimized/dv2-dsv2-series-memory), [Standard_D4alds_v6](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/daldsv6-series), [Standard_D4lds_v6](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dldsv6-series), or [Standard_D4alds_v5](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dldsv5-series). You can [view quotas for specific VM-families and submit quota increase requests](/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests) through the Azure portal.
