> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **March 17, 2027**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates Ubuntu 20.04. Any existing node images will be deleted, and you'll be unable to scale any node pools running Ubuntu 20.04. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by [upgrading your node pools](./upgrade-aks-cluster.md) to Kubernetes version 1.35+. For more information on this retirement, see [AKS GitHub issues](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).
