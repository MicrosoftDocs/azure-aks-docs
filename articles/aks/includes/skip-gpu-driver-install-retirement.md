> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **August 14, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports the `--skip-gpu-driver-install` node pool tag. After this date, you'll be unable to provision GPU-enabled node pools using this tag to bypass automatic GPU driver installation. You can achieve the same behavior by setting the `--gpu-driver` field to `none`. For more information on this retirement, see [`skip-gpu-driver` tag retirement](https://aka.ms/aks/skip-gpu-driver-tag-retirement).
