> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **August 14, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports the `--skip-gpu-driver-install` node pool tag. After this date, you'll be unable to provision GPU-enabled node pools using this tag to bypass automatic GPU driver installation. You can achieve the same behavior by setting the `--gpu-driver` field to `none`. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4925) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=496440). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
