> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting on **May 15, 2026**, AKS no longer supports Windows Annual Channel (Preview). AKS will no longer produce new Windows Annual Channel node images or provide security patches. On **May 15, 2027**, AKS will remove all existing Windows Annual Channel node images, which will cause scaling operations to fail. To avoid disruption, we recommend migrating to the [Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](/azure/aks/upgrade-windows-os). For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](ADD-LINK) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](ADD-LINK). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
